        "\n",
        "Multi-step tool use is an extension of this basic idea, and allows the model to call more than one tool in a sequence of steps, using the results from one tool call in a subsequent step. This process allows the language model to reason, perform dynamic actions, and quickly adapt on the basis of information coming from external sources.\n",

In 1985, with 9 stores, Best Buy became a public company. By 1987, Best Buy had 24 stores and sales of $240 million, but it was beginning to feel the crunch as other rapidly expanding consumer electronics retailers pushed their way into the market.'}, {'url': 'https://www.company-histories.com/Best-Buy-Co-Inc-Company-History.html', 'content': 'As the Best Buy chain pushed past the 500-store mark in 2003 with the opening of 67 new stores in the United States, including the first stores in Alaska, Idaho, Utah, and West Virginia, the situation at the Musicland chains was deteriorating. Returning to the Core: 2003 and Beyond\\nDespite the completion of this acquisition, Best Buy pushed ahead with a previously planned expansion of the Best Buy chain into Canada, opening eight stores in the Toronto area in the fall of 2002. Significant changes were made to the product mix, particularly by eliminating slower selling product lines and models; a greater emphasis was placed on selling service plans to customers; and \"high touch\" areas were added to the stores to help sell the burgeoning array of digital consumer products, such as cameras, cellular phones, satellite systems, and the fast-selling DVD player (first introduced in 1996) for which customers often needed more assistance. This rapid growth in digital product sales also inspired a shift in the overall product mix: sales of consumer electronics products (33 percent of the total) surpassed the sales of home office products (31 percent) for the first time (in 1999 these figures were 27 percent and 36 percent, respectively). Magnolia was founded in 1954 by Len Tweten, who built the firm into one of the most respected audio-video retailers in the nation based on the high quality of its merchandise, its dedication to exceptional customer service, and its renowned in-house repair/installation department.'}, {'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Best_Buy', 'content': 'Under the Geek Squad brand, Best Buy offers computer repair, warranty service, and accidental service plans.[2] Best Buy provides an online community forum for members, where consumers can discuss product experiences, ask questions, and get answers from other members or retail product experts.[82]\\nThe building exteriors of Best Buy-branded stores are typically light brown, with the entrance designed to look like a blue box emerging from the structure.[83] Corporate employees operated under a results only work environment from 2005 until March 2013, when the management style was abandoned by Best Buy CEO Hubert Joly.[84][85]\\nAs of October 29, 2016, Best Buy operated 1,026 Best Buy, 331 Best Buy Mobile stand-alone stores, and 28 stand-alone Pacific Sales stores in the US.[2] Best Buy also operated: 135 Best Buy and 53 Best Buy Mobile stand-alone stores in Canada; and 18 Best Buy stores and 5 Best Buy Express stores in Mexico.[2] Best Buy exited the European market in April 2013, selling its stake in the business back to its partner Carphone Warehouse.[71][72]\\nHouse brands[edit]\\nBest Buy also produces products under eight house brands:[2]\\nControversies[edit]\\nWarranty[edit]\\n The company, in announcing the result, said it was focusing more on digital media in its marketing, moving away from newspaper, magazine, and television advertising.[73]\\nOn March 28, 2015, Best Buy announced the shutdown of the Future Shop chain in Canada; 65 of its 131 former locations were converted into Best Buy locations, while the rest (primarily those in close proximity to an existing Best Buy) were closed permanently.[74]\\nOn March 1, 2018, the company announced that it would shut down its 250 standalone Best Buy Mobile stores in the United States by the end of May, due to low revenue and high costs. In August 2022, Best Buy said it would be laying off employees across the country after warnings of weaker sales, and the company cut its forecast for the remainder of 2022.[79]\\nOn October 13, 2023, Best Buy announced that it would phase out the sale of physical home media in early 2024, citing changes in the market due to the prevalence of streaming video on demand services.[80][81]\\nCorporate affairs[edit]\\nBusiness operations[edit]\\nBest Buy sells consumer electronics and a variety of related merchandise, including software, video games, music, mobile phones, digital cameras, car stereos, and video cameras, in addition to home appliances (washing machines, dryers, and refrigerators), in a noncommissioned sales environment.[2] The Best Buy Mobile stores were reported to account for 1% of the company\\'s revenue.[75]\\nOn May 9, 2018, the company unveiled a new logo for the first time in nearly three decades.[76]\\nOn July 2, 2018, Best Buy announced it was cutting the amount of store space devoted to selling physical music, citing the popularity of streaming services as having reduced sales.[77]\\nOn April 15, 2019, Best Buy announced that in June 2019, its current CFO, Corie Barry, would replace Hubert Joly[5] who held the position of CEO since August 2012. The customer was indicted for possession of child pornography, although the judge in the case later threw out nearly all the evidence against the defendant due to \"false and misleading statements\" made by an FBI agent while trying to secure a search warrant for the customer\\'s house, and the government ultimately dropped the case.[97]\\nPrivacy[edit]\\nOn October 20, 2023, CBC News released the results of a Marketplace investigation which found that that Best Buy technicians had viewed private files, such as intimate photos, on customer devices.'}]\u001b[0m\u001b[32;1m\u001b[1;3m\n",
