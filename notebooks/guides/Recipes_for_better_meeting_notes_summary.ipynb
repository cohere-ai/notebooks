        "# Recipes for better meeting notes summaries\n",
        "\n",
        "This notebook builds on top of [our guide towards building better meeting summaries](https://github.com/cohere-ai/notebooks/blob/22dceb0ce27d73cc27f74cbf2b7c82568cbd26b7/notebooks/Meeting_Summaries_General_%26_LangChain.ipynb). In that guide, we saw how to use Command-R to summarize meeting transcripts with a focus on imparting distinct formatting requirements.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this notebook, we'll cover useful recipes that we use internally to summarize our own meeting notes automatically (see [this guide](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1BTAAV4ss-iPtxT0ueS7djbIIwPSt3Dpp) for an outline of the full system). We will focus on extracting specific items from the meeting notes, namely:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Extract action items with assignees (who's on the hook for which task)\n",
        "2. Summarise speaker perspectives (who said what)\n",
        "3. Focus on a narrow topic (what was said about a given topic)\n",
        "\n",
        "Finally, we'll show that prompting the model for 1.-3. can be combined with the formatting instructions covered from our previous guide.\n",
