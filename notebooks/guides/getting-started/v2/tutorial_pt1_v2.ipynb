    "This tutorial is split over seven parts, with each part focusing on one use case, as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Part 1: Installation and Setup (Pre-requisite)\n",
    "- Part 2: Text Generation\n",
    "- Part 3: Chatbots\n",
    "- Part 4: Semantic Search\n",
    "- Part 5: Reranking\n",
    "- Part 6: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)\n",
    "- Part 7: Agents with Tool Use\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll learn about these use cases by building an onboarding assistant that helps new hires onboard to a fictitious company called Co1t. The assistant can help write introductions, answer user questions about the company, search for information from e-mails, and create meeting appointments.\n",
