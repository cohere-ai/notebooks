For example, [temperature](https://docs.cohere.ai/temperature-wiki) tunes the degree of randomness in the generations. Other parameters include [top-k and top-p](https://docs.cohere.ai/token-picking) as well as `frequency_penalty` and `presence_penalty` which can reduce the amount of repetition in the output of the model. See the [API reference of the generate endpoint](https://docs.cohere.ai/generate-reference) for more details on all the parameters."
