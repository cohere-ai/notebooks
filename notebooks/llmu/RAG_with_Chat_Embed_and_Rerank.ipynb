        "- **Response synthesis**: The model can decide if none of the retrieved documents provide the necessary information required to answer a user message. For example, when asked the question \"What do you know about 5G networks\", the chatbot goes on and retrieves external information from the index. However, it doesn’t use any of the information in its response as none of them is relevant to the question."
