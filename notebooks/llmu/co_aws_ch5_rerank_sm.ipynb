    "What’s great about reranking is that while it gives a huge boost to search results, implementing Cohere’s Rerank models requires adding only one line of code to any existing search system, whether a semantic search system or a traditional search system that uses keyword-based approaches.\n",

    "In this notebook, we'll explore how to use the Cohere Rerank endpoint on Amazon SageMaker. In particular, we'll look at an example of a multi-aspect search on semi-structured data, and walk through how to perform reranking on email data that contains multiple fields: “title” and “content.”"
