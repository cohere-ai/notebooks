    "# Rerank Endpoint\n",
    "\n",
    "Enterprise data is often complex, and current systems have difficulty searching through multi-aspect and semi-structured data sources. The most useful data at companies is not often in simple document format, and semi-structured data formats such as JSON are common across enterprise applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Rerank API Endpoint, powered by the [Rerank 3](https://docs.cohere.com/docs/rerank-2) model, can search over semi-structured data that is represented as JSON. You can simply take your JSON documents, e.g. from an Elasticsearch or MongoDB, and pass it to the Rerank 3 model. By setting the rank fields, you can select which fields should be considered by the model for the reranking.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll see how to use Rerank 3 to rank complex, multi-aspect data (e.g. emails) based on all of their relevant metadata fields. The diagram below provides an overview of what we'll build.\n",
    "\n",

    "- **Step 1: Define a JSON Dataset** - Define the email dataset.\n",
    "- **Step 2: Define Fields for the Reranking** - Select which fields should be considered by the model.\n",
    "- **Step 3: Call the Rerank Endpoint** - Pull results deemed most relevant to two sample queries.\n",
