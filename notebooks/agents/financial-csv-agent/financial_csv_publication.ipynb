    "# Financial CSV Agent with Langchain\n",

    "# Notebook Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "## Motivation\n",
    "Tabular data reasoning continues to be an exciting application of Agents, particularly in the financial domain, where multiple reasoning steps may be needed to identify the right answer. For example, a financial analyst working with financial statements may be interested in computing various financial ratios with natural language queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some examples may include:\n",
    "- ROE (Return on Equity) = Net Income / Shareholder's Equity\n",
    "- Net Profit Margin = Net Income / Revenue\n",
    "- Asset Turnover = Revenue / Average Total Assets\n",
    "- Financial Leverage = Average Total Assets / Shareholder's Equity\n",
    "\n",
    "Having an Agent which is able to correctly compute these and other ratios would be a great help for any analyst in the field of Finance.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective\n",
    "In this notebook we explore how to setup a [Cohere ReAct Agent](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain-cohere/blob/main/libs/cohere/langchain_cohere/cohere_agent.py) to answer questions over tables in Apple's SEC10K 2020 form. We show how this can be done with two variants of a Langchain Python tool, one that requires you to pass the full path of the dataframe and another that requires the dataframe objects to be loaded in memory. While there is no major difference between the two approaches, we present both to show how to manage files that are loaded in memory vs files in storage. \n",
