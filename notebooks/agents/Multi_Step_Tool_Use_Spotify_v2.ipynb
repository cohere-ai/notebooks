One of the most influential female artists of the 21st century, Shakira is credited with opening the doors of the international market for other Latin artists.[7][8] With a catalog of 145 songs, Shakira has sold over 95 million records, making her one of the best-selling music artists of all time.[9] Billboard reported that as of 2023, she is the best-selling female Latin artist of all time.[10] Noted to be a \"global phenom\" whose impact has \"reached every corner of the world\", Shakira has been described as an \"artistic link between the west and the east\" for popularizing Middle Eastern sounds in the West, and western sounds in the East (mainly the Middle East).[11][12] \"[140]\\nInfluences\\nAs a child, Shakira was influenced by rock music, listening heavily to rock bands like Led Zeppelin,[141] the Beatles, Nirvana,[142] the Police and U2,[143] while her other influences included Gloria Estefan, Madonna, Sheryl Crow, Alanis Morissette, Marc Anthony, Meredith Brooks, and the Cure.[144][145] She cited Depeche Mode\\'s \"Enjoy the Silence\" as the song that first sparked her passion for pop music.[146]\\nDance\\nShakira is well known for her dancing in her music videos and concerts.[147] Her distinctive dancing style is said to combine Latin dancing with Middle Eastern belly dancing,[147][148] which is derived from her Lebanese heritage,[147] and her hip shaking is mentioned in songs, such as Fifth Harmony\\'s \"Brave Honest Beautiful\".[149] She is noted for usually employing minimal production, usually taking the stage with minimal makeup and natural hair, and without background dancers in her performances, preferring to focus on her vocals, dance moves, and stage presence.[150] Lola Indigo,[247] Young Miko,[248] Nora Fatehi,[249] Kris Kross Ámsterdam,[250] Bad Gyal,[251] Jackson Wang,[252] and Ayra Starr.[253]\\nShakira has even received the admiration of intellectuals and writers such as Nobel Prize winner Gabriel García Márquez who has said \"No one of any age can sing or dance with the innocent sensuality Shakira seems to have invented\".[25] Márquez wrote an essay exalting Shakira\\'s \"phenomenal musical talent\", and \"extraordinary maturity\".[159]\\nThe newspaper El Correo del Golfo wrote that Shakira was the greatest exponent of Middle Eastern music in the West, citing her interest in Arabic music and dance.[172]\\nHer influence has transcended the boundaries of pop culture, that she has become a socio-political influencer, and was named as one of the \"World\\'s Greatest Leaders\" of 2017 by Fortune.[254] His lawsuit was dismissed by a Los Angeles County Superior Court judge in August\\xa02013.[317]\\nShakira entered a relationship with the Spanish football player Gerard Piqué in 2011.[318][319] Piqué, who is exactly ten years her junior, and Shakira met in spring 2010 after he appeared in the music video for Shakira\\'s song \"Waka Waka (This Time for Africa)\", the official song of the 2010 FIFA World Cup.[315] Shakira gave birth to the couple\\'s first son, Milan, on 22\\xa0January 2013 in Barcelona, where the family took residence.[320] Shakira gave birth to their second son, Sasha, on 29\\xa0January 2015.[321] Forbes listed Shakira and Piqué in their list of \"World\\'s Most Powerful Couples\".[322]', 'score': 0.19436783, 'raw_content': None}] \n",
