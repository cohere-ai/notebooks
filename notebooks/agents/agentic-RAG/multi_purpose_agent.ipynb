    "# Multi-Purpose Agentic Assistant with RAG, Evaluation, Human Input, Web Search, and Python Tool\n",
    "\n",
    "## Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "How do we build a helpful assistant that has the ability to search over many different internal knowledge bases and web? Can the assistant do math? Instead of having to build separate assistants for different use cases such as IT assistant, HR assistant, general LLM, or Python interpreter, you can equip agents with multiple tools so that you can build a single system that can handle different use cases. Based on user query, the LLM can decide what tool to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "Useful and capable assistant should have access to multiple knowledge bases such as Slack, Google Drive, Notion, Jira, and more. In this situation, you can either build a single database with multiple data sources or handle each one separately depending on the requirement and complexity of combining multiple sources. In this notebook, we showcase how we give the model different tool per different data source so that the model can query relevant databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then it evaluates retrieved documents using a modified version of [Correctness from LlamaIndex](https://github.com/run-llama/llama_index/blob/main/llama-index-core/llama_index/core/evaluation/correctness.py) evaluator template. If the score is low, it asks the user for permission to do a web search to find the answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on the question, the agent also has the ability to use Python to handle user's question.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will showcase how an agent can equip LLM with multiple tools like RAG and web search to become a useful assistant.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "- \"How much do we get for a referral?\" -> HR question\n",
    "- \"How do I set up api key for cohere?\" -> IT Question\n",
    "- \"Is cohere available on aws\" -> web search question\n",
    "- \"How much do I get a year on learning and development, and can you calculate how much I can spend per week?\" --> HR question + Calculation\n",
    "\n",
