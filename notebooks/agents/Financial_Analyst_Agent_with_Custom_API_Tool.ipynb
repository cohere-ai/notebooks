Commodities Future Trading Commission (CFTC)The CFTC oversees the U.S. derivatives markets, including futures contracts, options, and over-the-counter (OTC) markets. While the rules that the CFTC has oversight of were part of the Commodities Exchange Act (CEA), which was passed in 1936, the Commission itself was established in 1974 by the passage of the Commodities Futures Trading Commission Act. The mission of the CFTC is to enforce laws, rules, and regulations within the derivatives markets it oversees to help ensure that firms and individuals operating in such markets provide legally required privacy rights to their consumers and promote the integrity, resilience, and vibrancy of the U.S. derivatives markets through sound regulation.2.

Financial data compliance requirements include specific directives related to email. To adhere to Dodd-Frank financial data compliance requirements related to communication, financial organizations must take steps to preserve email communication within proscribed periods of time with redundancy and other procedures to ensure that it is protected.  Office for the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) The Office for the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) is an independent bureau of the U.S. Department of the Treasury that charters, regulates, and supervises all national banks and federal savings associations, as well as federal branches and agencies of foreign banks.

Drivers for Financial Data ComplianceWhy are Compliance Laws Important?Limitations of Compliance LawsTips for Complying with Data Security RegulationsFinancial Data Compliance Improves Overall SecurityWhat Is Financial Compliance?Financial compliance is financial institutions’ (e.g., financial services organizations, capital markets) adherence to internal and external rules set forth by governments, industry groups, and internal governance policies. Financial data compliance is a governance structure focused on data protection that ensures that an organization complies with laws, regulations, and standards around its data. Financial data compliance includes processes and security tools to govern and secure the possession, organization, storage, and management of digital assets or data to prevent loss, theft, misuse, or compromise. Different financial data compliance regulations specify the types of data that require protection and, in some cases, direct what should be done to ensure its security.The growing stringency of financial data compliance requirements also pushes organizations to rethink updating legacy security systems.Origin of Financial ComplianceThe term was first used by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS, the primary global standard setter for the prudential regulation of banks) in 2005. In its document “Compliance and the compliance function in banks,” the body defines compliance, “The expression compliance risk is defined in this paper as the risk of legal or regulatory sanctions, material financial loss, or loss to reputation a bank may suffer as a result of its failure to comply with laws, regulations, rules, related self-regulatory organization standards, and codes of conduct applicable to its banking activities.”Financial data compliance helps organizations prevent legal issues and financial\n",

While SOX does not specify any specific controls to protect financial data, encryption is widely considered to be the best practice.SWIFT CSPSociety for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT) is a Belgian cooperative society providing services related to the execution of financial transactions and payments between banks worldwide. Financial organizations that use SWIFT services must comply with SWIFT Customer Security Program (CSP) requirements. The framework outlines requirements for data protection, access management, and incident response. The SWIFT Customer Security Controls Framework has three objectives with eight principles.1. Secure your environmentRestrict internet accessSegregate critical systems from general IT environmentsReduce attack surface and vulnerabilitiesPhysically secure the environment2. Know and limit access Prevent compromise of credentials Manage identities and segregate privilege3. Detect and respondDetect anomalous activity in systems or transactional recordsPlan for incident response and information sharingExamples of the United Kingdom (U.K.) and European Union (E.U.) Drivers for Financial Data ComplianceGeneral Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) GDPR is the primary law regulating how organizations protect E.U. citizens’ personal data, setting forth stringent financial data compliance requirements. Several of the financial data requirements for GDPR that impact financial institutions are:Individuals must give explicit consent for their personal data to be collected and used.Individuals must understand how their information is going to be used.Organizations must clearly stipulate the legal channels available should data processing not comply with its agreed-upon use.All personal data must be destroyed after a prescribed period of time.In the event of a serious cyberattack, organizations must inform all those affected by the security breach and the Information Commissioner’s Office within 72 hours.Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II (MiFID II)The primary objective of MiFID II is to enhance investor protection with increased transparency and reporting, enhanced governance rules, and heightened regulation of markets.Related to financial data compliance, MiFID II, banks, and financial firms must implement common data processes and data quality metrics, which requires the adoption of data standards to ensure consistency of reporting across all regulated activities. Financial institutions must also manage multiple identiﬁers, including industry standard Market Identiﬁer Codes (MIC) and the Global Legal Entity Identiﬁer (LEI) to meet financial data compliance requirements.Why are Compliance Laws Important?Financial\u001b[0m\u001b[32;1m\u001b[1;3mRelevant Documents: 0\n",
