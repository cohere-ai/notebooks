    "# Tool Use - Simple Data Analyst Agent with Cohere and Langchain\n",
    "\n",
    "Tool use is a method whichs allows developers to connect Cohere's Command models to external tools like search engines, APIs, databases, and other software tools. Just like how [Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)](https://docs.cohere.com/docs/retrieval-augmented-generation-rag) allows a model to use an external data source to improve factual generation, tool use is a capability that allows retrieving data from multiple sources. But it goes beyond simply retrieving information and is able to use software tools to execute code, or even create entries in a CRM system.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll see how we can use two tools to create a simple data analyst agent that is able to search the web and run code in a python interpreter. This agent uses Cohere's Command R+ mode and Langchain.\n",
