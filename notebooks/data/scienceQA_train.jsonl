One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design.\nThe passage below describes how the engineering-design process was used to test a solution to a problem. Read the passage. Then answer the question below.\n\nDustin was an aerospace engineer who was developing a parachute for a spacecraft that would land on Mars. He needed to add a vent at the center of the parachute so the spacecraft would land smoothly. However, the spacecraft would have to travel at a high speed before landing. If the vent was too big or too small, the parachute might swing wildly at this speed. The movement could damage the spacecraft.\nSo, to help decide how big the vent should be, Dustin put a parachute with a 1 m vent in a wind tunnel. The wind tunnel made it seem like the parachute was moving at 200 km per hour. He observed the parachute to see how much it swung.\nFigure: a spacecraft's parachute in a wind tunnel.\nQuestion: Which of the following could Dustin's test show?\nOptions:(A) how steady a parachute with a 1 m vent was at 200 km per hour (B) if the spacecraft was damaged when using a parachute with a 1 m vent going 200 km per hour (C) whether a parachute with a 1 m vent would swing too much at 400 km per hour\nAnswer:"}, {"role": "Chatbot", "content": "A"}]}

Females often groom, or clean, their eggs. The females lick their eggs and turn them over in the nest to groom them.\nWhen female earwigs groom eggs, the eggs hatch more often. This is because grooming helps to remove mold from the surface of the eggs. Mold often lives in the soil around the nest and can infect and kill the eggs.\nFigure: a female European earwig caring for her eggs.\nQuestion: Why might grooming eggs increase the reproductive success of a female European earwig?

Female baboons in a group can form social bonds, or close relationships, with other females. Most female baboons form social bonds, but some have stronger bonds than others. Females that have stronger social bonds spend more time grooming, or cleaning, each other.\nWhen a female has strong social bonds with other females, more of her offspring reach adulthood than the offspring of females with weak social bonds. This may be because having strong social bonds helps a female handle stress. When female baboons are stressed, the females that have strong social bonds spend more time together.

The daytime sky becomes dark as sunlight is blotted out. Is it a terrible thunderstorm? No, it's actually a flock of thousands of passenger pigeons zooming overhead! Hundreds of years ago, there were three to five billion passenger pigeons in America, and the incredible sight of a flock's flight was a regular event. Sadly, passenger pigeons are extinct. None are left today.\nPassenger pigeons were a migratory bird. Migratory birds move about from season to season searching for places to nest and feed. The passenger pigeon migration ranged from Canada all the way to Texas and Florida. During a migration, thousands of birds would fly together from morning to night for several days. People reported seeing flocks as large as a mile wide! The migrations took place in spring and fall, when warmer weather brought forests to life with fresh food sources like nuts, seeds, berries, and insects.\nAt first, it seemed as though passenger pigeons were an endless supply of tasty meat. When a massive flock passed by, hunters could easily catch a few passenger pigeons without affecting the others. But later, hunters would travel to find nesting sites. A passenger pigeon nesting site might contain over one million birds. The birds usually nested close together, and hunters found them to be easy targets.\nEventually this overhunting destroyed the pigeon population. The last known passenger pigeon in the world died at the Cincinnati Zoological Garden in 1914. The pigeon, named Martha, was twenty-nine years old. Although the extinction of the passenger pigeon is a terrible loss, it did have one happy result: it pushed people to create wildlife protection laws to protect other creatures from a similar fate.\nQuestion: Based on the text, which of the following things made the passenger pigeon migration a special event?\nOptions:(A) The migration caused warmer weather and forest growth.

The movement could damage the spacecraft.\nSo, to help decide how big the vent should be, Steven put a parachute with a 1 m vent in a wind tunnel. The wind tunnel made it seem like the parachute was moving at 200 km per hour. He observed the parachute to see how much it swung.\nFigure: a spacecraft's parachute in a wind tunnel.\nQuestion: Which of the following could Steven's test show?\nOptions:(A) whether a parachute with a 1 m vent would swing too much at 400 km per hour (B) if the spacecraft was damaged when using a parachute with a 1 m vent going 200 km per hour (C) how steady a parachute with a 1 m vent was at 200 km per hour\nAnswer:"}, {"role": "Chatbot", "content": "C"}]}

In 1863, pedals were added. A few years later, a new, lighter bike was developed that used a very large front wheel and a small rear wheel. Called the \"Ariel,\" it became popular but was quite accident-prone.

But the plant can also get nutrients from other sources, including from the feces of woolly bats.\nA woolly bat can roost, or settle to sleep, in the upper part of the plant's trap. In the trap, the bat is protected from predators and bad weather. When the bat roosts, it can drop waste, including feces, into the bottom of the trap. The bottom of the trap holds a liquid that helps the plant digest the feces.

{"messages": [{"role": "User", "content": "Context: Read the text.\nHumans, like members of many other mammalian species, are monogastrics, which means that they have a single-chambered stomach. Some other mammalian species, though, are ruminants, which means that their stomachs have four chambers instead of one. Ruminants are perhaps most well-known for how much chewing they do during their digestive process. When a ruminant, such as a deer, eats food, the first two chambers of the animal's stomach extract the liquid from the food. The solid remainder of the food, known as the cud, is then regurgitated back into the animal's mouth to be chewed again. This allows the animal to extract more nutrients than it would otherwise. This is ideal for animals that eat plant-based diets, so it's no coincidence that ruminants are always herbivores.\nQuestion: Which term matches the picture?\nOptions:(A) ruminant (B) monogastric\nAnswer:"}, {"role": "Chatbot", "content": "A"}]}

He needed to add a vent at the center of the parachute so the spacecraft would land smoothly. However, the spacecraft would have to travel at a high speed before landing. If the vent was too big or too small, the parachute might swing wildly at this speed. The movement could damage the spacecraft.\nSo, to help decide how big the vent should be, Jordan put a parachute with a 1 m vent in a wind tunnel. The wind tunnel made it seem like the parachute was moving at 200 km per hour. He observed the parachute to see how much it swung.\nFigure: a spacecraft's parachute in a wind tunnel.\nQuestion: Which of the following could Jordan's test show?\nOptions:(A) how steady a parachute with a 1 m vent was at 200 km per hour (B) whether a parachute with a 1 m vent would swing too much at 400 km per hour (C) if the spacecraft was damaged when using a parachute with a 1 m vent going 200 km per hour\nAnswer:"}, {"role": "Chatbot", "content": "A"}]}

Decomposers, in contrast, often don't have mouths, so they must externally digest the dead organic matter. They break the matter into simpler parts, often dissolving it, and then absorb the broken-down matter. Fungi and bacteria are examples of decomposers.

When an egg hatches, the white of the broken eggshell stands out from the brown nest. This makes it easier for crows and other predators to find the nest and eat the offspring in it.\nAfter an egg hatches, the parent gull leaves the nest to carry the broken eggshell away.

{"messages": [{"role": "User", "content": "Context: Read the text about sloths.\nSloths are known for being one of the slowest animals on the planet. They also sleep up to twenty hours every day. Even though sloths are lethargic, they manage to stay safe by living in the treetops of South and Central America. Sloths have special qualities that help them spend their lives hanging from branches.\nFor example, sloths' long fur grows in the opposite direction from that of most animals. Most animals' fur grows downward, which helps rainwater run down off the animal. Sloths' fur, however, grows upward. When a sloth is hanging upside down, rainwater is still directed off its body. This helps the sloth dry off more quickly. Sloth fur has another special purpose. Each strand of fur has grooves that collect algae. The algae give the sloth a greenish color, which helps it blend in with its leafy environment. Along with sloths' slow movement, this disguise makes sloths hard for predators to spot.\nSloths also have long, curved claws on their front and back legs. Sloths can use their claws to protect themselves from predators. More importantly, the long, sharp claws curve around branches for a powerful grip. In this way, sloths' claws keep them from slipping and falling out of trees.\nHanging upside down all day can be hard for other reasons. In most animals, hanging would cause the stomach, heart, and other organs to press on the lungs. Not for sloths, though. Sloths have special bands of tissue called adhesions that help attach certain organs to the rib cage. These bands of tissue hold the organs in place so they don't press down on the sloth's lungs. Thus the sloth stays healthy and comfortable while hanging in its upside-down world.\nQuestion: Based on the text, how does a sloth's fur help protect it?\nOptions:(A) A sloth's fur protects its important organs. (B) A sloth's fur helps it hide from predators. (C) A sloth's fur helps it cling to tree branches.\nAnswer:"}, {"role": "Chatbot", "content": "B"}]}

Believe it or not, the oceans contain a lizard-like creature called the blue glaucus or blue dragon. However, these \"dragons\" are not the fire-breathing beasts of fantasy. In fact, they are only about an inch long. Blue dragons are a type of sea slug.\nAlthough these slugs are cuter than legendary dragons, you shouldn't let their squishy bodies fool you. These tiny creatures can be dangerous! Blue dragons eat poisonous sea creatures, such as Portuguese man-of-wars. The blue dragons store their prey's venom in their many \"fingers.\" They can then use that stored poison to defend themselves. So, never touch a blue dragon\u2014unless you want to get a painful and possibly serious sting.\nBlue dragons have another way to stay safe from predators. They float on their backs so their bright blue bellies point upward. The blue blends in with the water, making it hard for predators flying overhead to see them. And predators swimming below will have trouble spotting the dragons' gray backs. The light color blends with the sunlight shining down through the water. This two-color effect is called countershading, and it's a good way to avoid getting eaten!\nYou might see blue dragons washed up on some beaches, but they usually drift on warm surfaces of the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans. An air bubble in their stomach allows them to float for long periods of time. It is difficult for scientists to find these tiny creatures in the vast oceans. So, there is still much we don't know about them. What we do know, though, is that these beautiful dragons are full of surprising traits.\nQuestion: Based on the text, why are blue dragons dangerous?\nOptions:(A) Their strong fingers squeeze prey.

{"messages": [{"role": "User", "content": "Context: Read the text about capybaras.\nWhat animal looks like a guinea pig and a hippopotamus? The world's largest rodent, the capybara! Also called capys, these animals enjoy being in wetlands and rain forest waters. They are strong swimmers that wade in mud to keep cool. Like guinea pigs, capys have short legs and chubby bodies with shaggy fur. Much like hippos, capys have their eyes, ears, and nostrils located high on their heads. This helps them check out their surroundings while staying mostly underwater. Staying out of sight is important when you're the favorite food of jaguars and snakes! Luckily, capybaras can hide underwater for five minutes at a time. Plus, their webbed toes help them paddle fast.\nCapybaras live in Central and South America, usually in groups of between ten and forty. They eat plants like grass, reeds, grains, melons, and squash. They eat a lot of tough plants that are rich in fiber. To help break the plants down, capybaras have long teeth that chew side to side. They also have special bacteria in their guts that help break down fiber.\nThough capybaras are happiest in the wild, they are easily trained. Zookeepers have taught these gentle rodents to walk onto scales to be weighed, go into crates, and sit still for physical exams. How do they do it? Food treats and belly rubs are fun rewards. Capybaras are so quick to learn that one was once used as a guide animal for a blind man in Suriname.\nThe capybara population is mostly stable, but capys are still threatened by deforestation. When large areas of trees are cleared, it reduces the capybaras' shelter. But now, people are starting to limit the number of trees people can cut in rain forests. This is good news for capybaras, as their home is being protected.\nQuestion: Which sentence correctly describes capybaras?\nOptions:(A) They are shy animals that usually hide in tall grass. (B) They are wild guinea pigs that live in mountain forests. (C) They are the closest relatives of the hippopotamus. (D) They are large rodents that are powerful swimmers.\nAnswer:"}, {"role": "Chatbot", "content": "D"}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "User", "content": "Context: A substance's chemical structure depends on the number and types of atoms in each of its molecules, as well as on how those atoms are arranged. Substances with different chemical structures have different physical and chemical properties.\nWhen a substance is a reactant in a chemical reaction, its chemical structure changes. During the reaction, the atoms that make up the reactants are rearranged to form products. After the reaction, the products together are composed of the same atoms as the reactants, but those atoms are arranged in a different way. So, the products have different chemical structures than the reactants.\nThe chemical reaction that produces soap is called saponification. During one type of saponification, oil and sodium hydroxide undergo a chemical change to produce glycerol and soap. As a result of this reaction, the soap has different properties than the oil and sodium hydroxide. Some of these properties are what give soap its cleaning ability.\nQuestion: Which of the following statements is true?\nOptions:(A) Together, the products of a chemical reaction have the same arrangement of atoms as the reactants.

{"messages": [{"role": "User", "content": "Context: Read the text about bats.\nSeveral kinds of animals \"talk\" to one another in the wild. Dolphins whistle, birds sing, and wolves howl. In recent years, researchers have paid more attention to animal \"languages,\" and they have made some surprising discoveries. Egyptian fruit bats, for example, have a very complex way of talking to one another. In fact, they are one of the few animals that direct their calls to another individual. Most animals make calls to their entire group. Bats can also share more complex information than other animals. This is because they have special sounds to communicate specific issues.\nResearchers at Tel Aviv University in Israel wanted to learn more about what bats are really saying to one another. First, scientist Yossi Yovel and his team recorded sound and video of twenty-two bats. Fifteen thousand bat calls were collected over a period of seventy-five days. Then, the researchers tried to match each bat call with a behavior. They used special software to help them tell different bat calls apart and decipher the bats' messages.\nWhat Yovel and his team found was astonishing. Egyptian fruit bats are not just making squeaky noises; they are expressing very distinct concerns. One type of call means the bats are arguing over food. Another type of call means the bats are figuring out where they are going to sleep. A third call is used when one bat has gotten too close to another.\nThe researchers made another startling discovery. A bat can alter the sound of its call when addressing different members of the group. This is similar to how humans may use a different tone of voice when speaking to different people. It turns out that bats use language as a way to communicate their needs to each other, almost like humans do.\nQuestion: Based on the text, how are fruit bats different from most other animals?\nOptions:(A) They can \"talk\" directly to one other fruit bat. (B) They can understand some human speech. (C) They can communicate with many kinds of animals.\nAnswer:"}, {"role": "Chatbot", "content": "A"}]}
