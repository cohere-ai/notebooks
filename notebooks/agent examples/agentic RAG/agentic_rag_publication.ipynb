    "# Notebook Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "## Motivation\n",
    "Asking questions over documents continues to be an important retrieval augmented generation (RAG) task. However, the document complexity can significantly influence overall RAG performance, particularly when the documents are PDFs that contain a mix of text and tables. Finding an optimal strategy to parse this information, chunk, embed and retrieve it is thus quite critical to obtaining accurate results. Furthermore, if the questions being asked over the retrieved documents require mathematical reasoning, then having a model that can validate those operations is quite useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective\n",
    "In this notebook we will guide you through the best practices of setting up a RAG pipeline to process documents that contain both tables and text. In addition, we will show you how to create a Cohere ReAct agent with access to a RAG pipeline tool to improve accuracy. The general structure of the nb is as follows:\n",

Information furnished by 22 departments showed that total benefits of ₹2,829.02 crore was paid outside Core DBT Portal under 168 schemes.\\n\\nAudit observed that the slow progress in onboarding the schemes by the user departments was due to lack of ICT applications and digitisation of the beneficiaries’ data.

As a result, 6.67 lakh beneficiaries were deprived of the financial benefit of ₹153.30 crore during the period 2018-19 and 2019- 20.\\n\\nThe State Government stated (December 2021) that it is the responsibility of the user department to monitor this activity for which the required MIS has already been published in the DBT portal.

The reply cannot be accepted as the Operations Group of the DBT Cell was entrusted with the responsibility of monitoring the progress of each department and ensuring last mile delivery benefits.\\n\\n2.2.4 Rejected transactions\\n\\nFourteen per cent of the total transactions under Core DBT were rejected at various transaction levels. Analysis showed that the rejections inter se were more at DDO level (60 per cent) and K2 level (38 per cent). It was observed that “Files pushed back to department” as per their request (57 per cent) was the major reason for the rejected transactions followed by “K2_BMSER-01:\\n\\n11\\n\\nChapter 2\\n\\nImplementation and Management of DBT\\n\\nMapping of given budget line and DDO not available” (20 per cent) and “Sanction Order has already been generated for some beneficiaries” (eight per cent) as indicated in Appendix 2.6.\\n\\nThis indicates that the departments concerned were not ascertaining the availability of the budget provision and the correctness of the payment files before sending for payment. Further, there exists no mechanism to monitor these rejected transactions for further processing of those transactions as a result of which Audit could not ensure whether corrective action was initiated to deliver ₹814.55 crore in respect of 42.02 lakh transactions.\\n\\nThe State Government stated (January 2022) that the transactions were rejected due to various reasons like validation failures at DBT and K2 level, failure at NPCI level and that DDOs can also reject the records in DBT and K2. Further it stated that some cases might have been rejected due to non- availability of funds and such cases might not be reinitiated. However, it agreed to create a mechanism to monitor the rejected transactions and stated that it would issue directives to the concerned departments to take corrective measure for reinitiating the rejected transactions.\\n\\nAudit does not accept the reply that the rejected transactions due to non- availability of funds might not be reinitiated. While the reply highlights the absence of necessary budget validation checks before processing the transactions for payments, not initiating the rejected transactions indicate the failure of the existing mechanism to track and process such transactions for timely delivery of services to the eligible beneficiaries.\\n\\n2.2.5 Timely movement of response files\\n\\nOn receipt of the response file from the bank in K2, it is then pushed to Core DBT and further to the native applications. Audit observed that the average time taken for movement of response files from K2 to Core DBT portal was 38 days (ranged between 0-270 days) and from Core DBT to native application was 21 days (ranged between 0-367 days). Only 29 and 18 per cent of the responses could be shared on the same day respectively.

As a result, there was some backlog.

The funds released under 422 and 423 are meant for payment of incentives to milk pourers under Scheduled Caste (SC) and Scheduled Tribe (ST) categories respectively. Though the registration of beneficiary module includes the category column (SC/ST/Others), there was no mechanism to trace the budget flow under these subheads in the Ksheerasiri application. This was important to identify the extent of failed, rejected and pending transactions under SC/ST category of beneficiaries. Further, in the absence of input validation controls, there was every possibility of the funds under SCP/TSP remaining unutilised.\\n\\nAs discussed in paragraph 3.1.1, the Department surrendered the unutilised amount under the scheme including the unspent amount under SCP/TSP. The surrender of funds under SCP/TSP was against the provisions of the Karnataka Scheduled Caste Sub-Allocation and Tribal Sub-Allocation (Planning, Allocation and Utilisation of Financial Resources) Act, 2013 and Rules, 2017 which stipulates that ‘in case of unspent amount out of allocation in a particular financial year, the same may be added to the next year allocation but shall not be carried further beyond that year’.\\n\\nThe State Government stated (December 2021) that steps would be taken to incorporate the budget module.\\n\\n26\\n\\nImplementation of DBT in selected schemes\\n\\nChapter 3\\n\\n3.1.2.4 System Requirement Specification and User Acceptance Test\\n\\nThe User Acceptance Testing (UAT) determines whether the application meets all the requirements of the user groups.

UAT is the final testing that is carried out before the software is brought on live. The FRS clearly describes the details of the architecture of the system for implementation.\\n\\nAudit observed that there were no documents to suggest that the SRS was duly prepared/scrutinised and UAT was conducted to ascertain that the Ksheerasiri application fulfilled the user requirements before it was live from April 2019 onwards.

Audit observed that benefits amounting to ₹2.04 crores for 5,513 beneficiaries was pushed directly through Beneficiary Management System (BMS) module of K2 and not through DBT application during the period 10 December 2019 to 31 March 2020.\\n\\n3.2.2 National Food Security Mission – Frontline Demonstration (DBT component)\\n\\nNational Food Security Mission, a Centrally Sponsored Scheme14 was launched in October 2007 to increase annual production of certain crops such as rice, pulses, coarse cereals, nutri-cereals, cotton, sugarcane, TRFA-Pulses, TRFA-Oil seeds, NFSM-Oil seeds. Frontline Demonstration (FLD), a component under NFSM involves demonstration of improved package of practices on farmers’ fields. The demonstrations should be conducted in cluster approach of at least 10 hectares and one demonstration at individual farmer should never be less than 0.4 hectare and not exceeding one hectare. The assistance of demonstration will be decided upon the area. The rate of assistance is `7500 for Rice, `5000 for Wheat and `5000 for Pulses per demonstration of one hectare respectively.\\n\\n3.2.2.1 Shortfall in payment to identified beneficiaries\\n\\nThe department identified total 1,62,375 beneficiaries for payment of benefits amounting to ₹57.78 crore but final payment was made for 1,46,865 beneficiaries amounting to ₹51.89 crore. Audit noticed that bills were not created by DDOs for 10,775 beneficiaries and payment in respect of remaining 4,735 beneficiaries were rejected due to technical issues. This has deprived 15,510 beneficiaries of the eligible benefits of ₹5.74 crore.\\n\\nThe State Government agreed (December 2021) with the audit findings and attributed the reasons for rejections to creation of duplicate sanction orders due to server issues. It further stated that bills could not be created by DDOs as the beneficiaries did not produce the required documents.

Manual validation carries the risk of erroneous or fraudulent processing and unreliable outputs. It is pertinent to mention here that 522 Extension Officers have to certify the collection details of 14,658 societies twice daily which is practically difficult and the increases the possibility of errors/ fraudulent practices remaining unnoticed.\\n\\nAudit also noticed that the department merely accepts the data furnished by KMF without further checks.

There\\n\\n23  \\n\\nChapter 3\\n\\nImplementation of DBT in selected schemes\\n\\nwere 3,178 and 1,027 such cases during April 2019 and May 2019 months respectively.\\n\\nAudit also observed that the ‘substandard milk quantity’ and ‘total milk poured’ fields were optional. Further, the quantity of good quality and sub- standard quality of milk supplied by an individual pourer are not entered in the Ksheerasiri directly. It is entered manually in the register or the native application used by the society and is updated on a monthly basis in Ksheerasiri at the camp office. As the milk collected in the societies are transferred to a common container and the milk with averaged fat content would be reaching the CC/BMC/Union, the possibility of extending incentives to the ineligible beneficiaries cannot be ruled out.\\n\\nAudit further observed in respect of one society (Alipura/ Gowribidanur), the Dairy register had recorded local sales of 1975.7 litres during August 2019 whereas the DBT figure was 16,404 litres. In respect of other society (Parandahalli/Bangarpet), the total quantity of milk collected in the society was 72,076 for the month of March 2020 whereas subsidy was reimbursed for 1,34,319.8 litres as seen from Ksheerasiri data.\\n\\nThe State Government stated (January 2022) that automated validation of the data at Camp Office and the Union level is not available. It however, stated that when Union validates before e-signing for a month, the total good quantity plus the local sales of all the milk societies should be equal or less than the quantity supplied to the Union and hence there is no scope for claiming more quantity in a month. The reply does not address the action taken to verify and rectify the discrepancies pointed out by audit. Moreover, the existing manual checks are inadequate to prohibit such discrepancies.', 'title': 'chunk 2'}]\u001b[0m\u001b[32;1m\u001b[1;3mRelevant Documents: 0\n",

The reason in 92 per cent of the cases was ‘input XML file already processed’ indicating the absence of validation.\\n\\nThe State Government stated (January 2022) that payment files for the initial claims (April 2019 to July 2019) were processed only from August 2019 due to technical issues and as the personnel were to be trained in use of the application. As a result, there was some backlog.

The funds released under 422 and 423 are meant for payment of incentives to milk pourers under Scheduled Caste (SC) and Scheduled Tribe (ST) categories respectively. Though the registration of beneficiary module includes the category column (SC/ST/Others), there was no mechanism to trace the budget flow under these subheads in the Ksheerasiri application. This was important to identify the extent of failed, rejected and pending transactions under SC/ST category of beneficiaries. Further, in the absence of input validation controls, there was every possibility of the funds under SCP/TSP remaining unutilised.\\n\\nAs discussed in paragraph 3.1.1, the Department surrendered the unutilised amount under the scheme including the unspent amount under SCP/TSP. The surrender of funds under SCP/TSP was against the provisions of the Karnataka Scheduled Caste Sub-Allocation and Tribal Sub-Allocation (Planning, Allocation and Utilisation of Financial Resources) Act, 2013 and Rules, 2017 which stipulates that ‘in case of unspent amount out of allocation in a particular financial year, the same may be added to the next year allocation but shall not be carried further beyond that year’.\\n\\nThe State Government stated (December 2021) that steps would be taken to incorporate the budget module.\\n\\n26\\n\\nImplementation of DBT in selected schemes\\n\\nChapter 3\\n\\n3.1.2.4 System Requirement Specification and User Acceptance Test\\n\\nThe User Acceptance Testing (UAT) determines whether the application meets all the requirements of the user groups. The essence of UAT is to validate the software to find out whether it meets the business requirements of the client as specified in the Functional Requirement Specifications (FRS) and System Requirement Specifications (SRS) documents. UAT is the final testing that is carried out before the software is brought on live. The FRS clearly describes the details of the architecture of the system for implementation.\\n\\nAudit observed that there were no documents to suggest that the SRS was duly prepared/scrutinised and UAT was conducted to ascertain that the Ksheerasiri application fulfilled the user requirements before it was live from April 2019 onwards.

In nine other\\n\\n24\\n\\nImplementation of DBT in selected schemes\\n\\nChapter 3\\n\\ninstances, claims of 1.28 lakh litres over and above the prescribed limits and amounting to `6.38 lakh was processed by the department for payment. The Department was yet to confirm whether the payments were actually made. Audit also noticed few instances where the amount paid for milk poured ranged between `6.4 lakh to `9.55 lakh per month during the period April 2019 to August 2020. Providing incentives to such beneficiaries defeats the very purpose of the incentive scheme. The State Government stated (January 2022) that the Department had fixed the upper limit initially at 40,000 litres per month so that the files are not rejected at K2. Further, the Government stated that upper limit was enhanced to 75,000 litres per month in Ksheerasiri and K2 Portal to make the payment for those milk pourers who poured the milk exceeding 40,000 litres after verification.\\n\\nThe reply does not address the vital issue of how the input validation was changed to 60,000 litres per month when upper limit fixed was 40,000 litres per month at that time. This shows the lack of internal controls and proper monitoring existing within the department. Further, the post facto enhancement of the upper limit was carried out by the Department without the approval the Finance department and the Government.\\n\\n3.1.2.2 Delay in processing of payment files\\n\\nThe payment annexure files in XML format are generated by the Department and pushed to the Core DBT portal through the Ksheerasiri application for financial and Aadhaar validations, de-duplication check and further processing and payments.

The DBT aimed to disburse payments through an Aadhaar linked bank account of the beneficiary. The Government implemented a centralised Core DBT Portal for de-duplication, identity and financial address validation of the beneficiaries. It envisaged to bring all DBT schemes of different departments in an integrated environment to enable direct system-to- system exchange of DBT data from native applications without manual interactions for the payment to the identified beneficiaries.\\\\n\\\\nThe Performance Audit (PA) attempted to ascertain whether necessary process re-engineering was done for implementation of DBT so as to minimise intermediary levels, delay in payment to intended beneficiaries, pilferage and duplication and whether the infrastructure, organization and management of DBT was adequate and effective. The PA involved data analysis and IT audit of Core DBT Portal and Ksheerasiri application along with data analysis of Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (State Share), National Food Security Mission (DBT component) and Raithasiri schemes of the Department of Agriculture.\\\\n\\\\nrae) CJ?\\\\n\\\\nCore DBT Portal and DBT Cell\\\\n\\\\nThe process of onboarding of the schemes onto the Core DBT Portal was slow as only 83 out 239 identified schemes could be onboarded as of April 2021. This slow process resulted in disbursement of benefits worth ₹2,829.02 crore outside Core DBT under 168 schemes by 22 departments.\\\\n\\\\n(Paragraph 2.1)\\\\n\\\\nWhile 83 per cent of the overall transactions were successful, 14 per cent of the transactions were rejected. The successful transactions ranged between 57 to 97 per cent under the test-checked schemes.\\\\n\\\\n(Paragraph 2.2.1)\\', \\'title\\': \\'chunk 1\\'}, {\\'id\\': \\'doc_0\\', \\'snippet\\': \\'Source: DBT data furnished by DBT Cell\\\\n\\\\nThe poor progress resulted in disbursements of benefits outside the DBT portal during the period 2018-20. Audit called for information from 42 departments to assess the quantum of the benefits outside Core DBT Portal. Information furnished by 22 departments showed that total benefits of ₹2,829.02 crore was paid outside Core DBT Portal under 168 schemes.\\\\n\\\\nAudit observed that the slow progress in onboarding the schemes by the user departments was due to lack of ICT applications and digitisation of the beneficiaries’ data. Though the Operations Group was responsible for identifying departments/schemes that come under the purview of DBT and ensuring timely onboarding of schemes and Technical Group for developing scheme specific ICT applications where such applications were not available, it was not done. Consequently, the DBT Cell did not have the information on\\\\n\\\\n❑ the number of schemes which were required to be identified for onboarding;\\\\n\\\\n❑ availability of the ICT infrastructure in the departments for the identified schemes; and\\\\n\\\\n5\\\\n\\\\nChapter 2\\\\n\\\\nImplementation and Management of DBT\\\\n\\\\n❑ the status of beneficiary database digitisation, seeding of beneficiary database with validated Aadhaar number etc., that are necessary for onboarding.\\\\n\\\\nThe State Government stated (December 2021) that the delay in onboarding of the schemes was due to the non-availability of IT systems in many of the departments. It further stated that the user departments could not develop their own IT systems due to lack of IT skills. Therefore, the centre for e-Governance has developed a configurable IT system called ‘Suvidha4’ using which multiple departmental schemes can be onboarded. The fact remains that the Operations and Technical Groups of the DBT Cell failed to handhold the departments for timely onboarding of the schemes onto the DBT Portal.\\\\n\\\\n2.2 Efficiency of implementation of DBT The efficiency of DBT is measured with reference to the extent of successful transactions and timely delivery of services.\\\\n\\\\n2.2.1 Successful transactions\\\\n\\\\nAnalysis of the transactions of Core DBT data (as of 20 October 2020) for the period 2018-205 showed that the overall success rate was 83 per cent (detailed in Appendix 2.1) and it ranged between 57 to 97 per cent under the test-checked schemes as detailed in Table 2.2.\\\\n\\\\nTable 2.2.: Status of transactions for the period 2018-20\\', \\'title\\': \\'chunk 0\\'}]'}])],\n",
