        "LLMs are not substitutes for medical expertise or advice, and should only be viewed as general informational support for healthcare professionals in tasks such as SOAP note summarization. LLM summaries may omit crucial details or introduce errors that could lead to harmful outcomes in patient care.\n",
        "\n",
        "When using summarization in this use-case, we recommend the ensuring the following:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Awareness: Healthcare professionals should be aware that SOAP note summaries may be generated or assisted by LLMs. The LLM's role and limitations should be clearly documented within patient care protocols.\n",
        "- Audit: A qualified healthcare professional should always carefully review and edit LLM-generated summaries before they are used for patient care decisions.\n",
        "- Testing: In addition, LLMs used for SOAP note summarization should undergo a regular cadence of testing and validation by healthcare professionals to ensure summaries accurately capture key clinical information and avoid propagating or introducing new biases, omissions of critical information, or other errors.\n",
        "- Rectification: Healthcare professionals must establish clear procedures for patients who experience issues due to inaccurate information in LLM-generated summaries. This may involve avenues for reporting errors, requesting corrections to the original SOAP note and modification to existing practices to prevent similar issues in the future.\n",
